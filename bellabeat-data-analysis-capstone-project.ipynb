The project is an analysis of fitness tracker usage data collected from FitBit users via a distributed survey from 03/12/2016 - 05/12/2016. The dataset includes data for 30 eligible users who submitted day, hour, and minute-level data recorded on their FitBit devices for a number of variables such as calories, heart rate, steps, sleep, and more. \n\nThe objective of this project is to understand how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. We will be attempting to answer the following questions:\n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence the Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\nWith these insights, we will be selecting one Bellabeat product to make recommendations for.\n\n## About the Data\n\nThe data is organised into 29 .csv files for each of the two months of data that were collected. These files are organised into different variables that were measured, as well as the rate at which the data was collected, e.g. Heart Rate (seconds), Calories (hourly and minute), etc.\n\nWe will be using the daily_activities.csv file as this contains information such as calories, intensities, and steps for each participant, we will also use the following .csv files to measure activity throughout the day: hourlyCalories, hourlyIntensities, and hourlySteps. And finally, we will also use sleepDay.csv to perform some analysis on the sleep patterns for the individuals in the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Import into BigQuery\n\nFor this project, we will be using Google's BigQuery platoform to host our files and perform SQL queries. Before starting to query our files, we create a data set and upload each of our files as tables. This is no problem for our first file 'daily_activities.csv' however we are presented with our first difficulty when uploading our other files. The date values present in our hourly and sleep data files won't mesh well with BigQuery, and do not immediately conform to its requirements for DATETIME values. \n\nSo we will upload these files as tables, and the affected columns as STRING data types, and run the following query to create a new table with the correct values for DATETIME.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Cleaning and Processing in SQL","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"-- Update ActivityHour column into DATETIME and remove 'AM' and 'PM' values for new_hourlycalories table from hourlycalories table\n\nCREATE TABLE `bellabeat-case-study-430106.Fitabase_Data_041216_051216.new_hourlycalories` AS\nSELECT\n    Id,\n    PARSE_DATETIME('%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', ActivityHour) AS ActivityHour,\n    Calories\nFROM\n    `bellabeat-case-study-430106.Fitabase_Data_041216_051216.hourlycalories`\nORDER BY\n    Id ASC,\n    ActivityHour ASC;\n\n-- Update ActivityHour column into DATETIME and remove 'AM' and 'PM' values for new_hourlyintensities table from hourlyintensities table\n\nCREATE TABLE `bellabeat-case-study-430106.Fitabase_Data_041216_051216.new_hourlyintensities` AS\nSELECT\n    Id,\n    PARSE_DATETIME('%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', ActivityHour) AS ActivityHour,\n    TotalIntensity,\n    AverageIntensity\nFROM\n    `bellabeat-case-study-430106.Fitabase_Data_041216_051216.hourlyintensities`\nORDER BY\n    Id ASC,\n    ActivityHour ASC;\n\n-- Update ActivityHour column into DATETIME and remove 'AM' and 'PM' values for new_hourlysteps table from hourlysteps table\n\nCREATE TABLE `bellabeat-case-study-430106.Fitabase_Data_041216_051216.new_hourlysteps` AS\nSELECT\n    Id,\n    PARSE_DATETIME('%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', ActivityHour) AS ActivityHour,\n    StepTotal\nFROM\n    `bellabeat-case-study-430106.Fitabase_Data_041216_051216.hourlysteps`\nORDER BY\n    Id ASC,\n    ActivityHour ASC;\n\n-- Update SleepDay column into DATE and remove 'AM' and 'PM' values and 'HH:MM:SS' for new_sleepday table from sleepday table\n\nCREATE TABLE `bellabeat-case-study-430106.Fitabase_Data_041216_051216.new_sleepday` AS\nSELECT\n    Id,\n    DATE(PARSE_DATETIME('%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p', SleepDay)) AS SleepDay,\n    TotalSleepRecords,\n    TotalMinutesAsleep,\n    TotalTimeInBed\nFROM\n    `bellabeat-case-study-430106.Fitabase_Data_041216_051216.sleepday`\nORDER BY\n    Id ASC,\n    SleepDay ASC;","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-08T17:19:10.894610Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-08T17:19:10.895416Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-08T17:19:10.935066Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-08T17:19:10.895377Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-08T17:19:10.933645Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  Cell \u001b[0;32mIn[1], line 3\u001b[0;36m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    CREATE TABLE `bellabeat-case-study-430106.Fitabase_Data_041216_051216.new_hourlycalories` AS\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m                                             ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid decimal literal\n"],"ename":"SyntaxError","evalue":"invalid decimal literal (3118044461.py, line 3)","output_type":"error"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that our columns are all the correct data types, we can continue with some more querying.

We will be omitting the 'low' level user from further analysis as it would skew our results and make them unreliable.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Figure 2\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7jnhazu.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our first visualisation illustrates the amount of daily 'Very Active Minutes' and 'Fairly Active Minutes' users undertake. This is segmented into two groups: 'high' and 'medium' level. We can see that the data for the 'high' level users doesn't change drastically day-by-day like we can see with 'medium' level users. However we also see that 'medium' level users have a clear preference for registering activity data on Saturdays. \n\nThe refrence line on the graph is set at 22 minutes (amounting to 150 per week), which is the recommended amount of moderate physical activity an adult should undertake every day [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Taking%20more%20steps%20a%20day,to%208%2C000%20steps%20per%20day.). We can see that all 'high' users surpass this amount, whereas for the 'medium' users it is sporadic, only going over the 22 minutes for 4 out of the 7 days a week. However, both groups manage to achieve over 150 minutes per week across all days.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Figure 3\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UpGU1kY.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n</div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see similar peaks and variations as well as further confirmation of a distinct bias towards Saturday for both 'high' and 'medium' level users. Some underlying trends however are an increased overall number of Calories Burned for 'high' users due to a higher level of activity across all days when compared to 'medium' level users.\n\nWe have omitted a reference line for calories as the recommended daily intake amount can vary wildly between sex, age, and lifestyle, ranging from 1,800 to 2,400 for women and 2,000 to 3,000 for men. As we dont have sufficient data available we can't reasonably ascertain how well our participants are doing against a baseline.\n\nFor total steps however, we have included a range of 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day as [recommended by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Taking%20more%20steps%20a%20day,to%208%2C000%20steps%20per%20day.). This range becomes lower for adults over the age of 60, recommending between 6,000 to 8,000 a day to reduce the risks of premature death linked to all causes. We see here that 'high' level participants are not hitting this target, barely achieving it 2 out of 7 days of the week, with the 'medium' level participants being farther away from it most days.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Figure 4\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/os6Zidy.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that we start analysing detailed hourly data, we can see some other trends emerge.

These users also show a similar level of intensity in the later hours, as it was with the 'high' level users. \n\nWe can determine that it is likely that 'high' level users do not have a very strong preference for hours of the day in which they engage in intense activities, however 'medium' level users engage in their most intense activitities before noon.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Figure 5\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Kki38e7.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This table displays the results we created earlier on from our SQL query.

The vast majority (29/33) of users that particicpated in this study are 'high' level, and use their smart devices to record activity data for more than 21 days in a month.\n2. 'High' level users do not have a preference for the day of the week in which they engage in 'fairly active' or 'very active' activities, whereas 'medium' level users have a heavy preference towards Saturdays.\n3. 'High' level users burn more calories on average than 'medium' level users, but have similar steps taken and distance covered.\n4. All users hit the target of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, but also fall short of the step target of 8,000 - 10,000\n5. 'Medium' level users engage in the most intense activities, especially in the early noon, whereas 'high' level users engage in more intense activities between 17:00 to 19:00\n6. Sleep data recording is slightly more varied, with 50% of all users recording data for 21 or more days, and 37.5% recording data for 11 days or less.\n7. All users are getting less sleep than is recommended.\n\nWith these isnights, we can make our final recommendations below.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Final Recommendations \n\nThe objective of this project was to harness data collected from users of FitBit smart devices to help unlock new growth opportunitites for Bellabeat. Now, we will focus on one of Bellabeat's products to help guide a marketing strategy for the company.\n\n## Products\n\n**Bellabeat app:** The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n\n**Leaf:** Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n\n**Time:** This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\n \n**Bellabeat membership:** Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users. Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.\n\n## Bellabeat Leaf\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can offer a few recommendations on a new marketing campaign and product updates for the Bellabeat Leaf Fitness Tracker. Currently, the vast majority of users record activities and wear their smart devices for over 21 days, but in order to gather the most reliable data and entice users to purchase into the Bellabeat membership model as well, we should find ways to entice higher levels of usage, with 'everyday' wear an end goal to achieve. Users may feel discouraged from wearing or using everyday if they find the device or interface difficult to use, or the battery life of the smart device to be too short to wear for multiple days in a row.\n\nTo increase general activity levels across all days of the week, daily goals can be integrated into the device and app, pushing the users and providing them with ways to set their own goals and celebrate their own milestones according to their individual fitness levels. Allowing users to set their own goals for steps could help them all move up into the 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day band of activity.\n\nTo encourage users to engage activities of higher intensity levels, daily exercise recommendations via the Bellabeat app can help give users ideas of what to do and how to fit in workouts with their busy schedules.\n\nFinally, overall amounts of sleep are an issue for all users. Setting sleep reminders in app, and through the Leaf Fitness Tracker could assist users in reminding them when to go to sleep and when to wake up in order to meet their goals. Making the Leaf more comfortable to wear in bed, and further increasing battery life or speed of charging could entice more users into recording their sleep, as currently only 50% of FitBit users analysed do so regularly.\n\nHelping users understand how everything the Bellabeat Leaf records throughout the day can assist them in leading healthier, more mindful, and more energetic lives will ultimately lead to customers who are satisfied with their purchases, and engage fully into the Bellabeat ecosystem of products.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Further Analysis with Additional Data\n\nThere were some limitations present in the data analysed. For a start, there were a few outlier observations that had to be excluded. Moreover, we worked with a relatively small sample size of only 33 users. With this in mind the analysis we were able to conduct was limited in scope. A future project could include not just a much larger number of participants, but also data pertaining to weight, height, age, as well as location data to help us dive deeper into trends across different demographics and regions. Allowing us to craft more bespoke recommendations targeting all of Bellabeat's market segments. \n\nMoreover, there is no way to distinguish aerobic and anaerobic activities in the data set. Recording such data would allow us to understand where activity is coming from, and how this impacts a user's fitness level. Some may prefer cardiovascular exercise such as running or jogging which would lead to higher distances and steps taken, whereas other may stick to strength training, or even swimming, which would record significantly less steps but lead to similar results for a user's overall fitness.","metadata":{}}]}
